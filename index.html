            <h3>What is git?</h3>
            Git is a type of version control software that makes it easy for multiple people to collaborate on a code base. 

            <h3>How does git work?</h3>
            Git works by saving multiple copies of the changed files. This allows software developers to make changes and then reverse those changes if the new code has bugs. Git also tracks when files are changed which simplifies the process of combining multiple versions of code.

            <h3>What is the history of git?</h3>
            Git was originally developed by Linus Torvald to help streamline the Linux kernel development process in 2005.

            <h2>Three Steps</h2>
            There are three steps for this tutorial that focus on starting, branching, and working with a remote server.

                <li>The <a href="starting.html">starting</a> section teaches you how to locally start a project and save your progress.</li>
                <li>The <a href="branching.html">branching</a> section teaches you how to create multiple versions of your project and then combine those versions together.</li>
                <li>The <a href="remote-server.html">remote server</a> section teaches you how to pull and push code changes to and from a remote server.</li>
